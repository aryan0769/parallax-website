        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>
            Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole.
            In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life.
            Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds,
            or outright separate and even superior to nature.People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, 
            and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other.
             The massive environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments:
              including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other chemicals in the air and water. 
              More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, 
              and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an agricultural field,
               the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, 
               but the structure is quite different.

        <h2> Nature Conservation</h2>
        <p>
            Conservation goals include conserving habitat, preventing deforestation, maintaining soil organic matter,
             halting species extinction, reducing overfishing, and mitigating climate change.
              Different philosophical outlooks guide conservationists towards these different goals.
            The principal value underlying many expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and 
            intangible worth along with utilitarian value â€“ a view carried forward by parts of the scientific conservation movement and
             some of the older Romantic schools of the ecology movement. Philosophers have attached intrinsic value to different aspects of nature, whether this is individual organisms (biocentrism) or ecological wholes such as species or ecosystems.
